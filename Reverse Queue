/*You have been given a queue that can store integers as the data. 
You are required to write a function that reverses the populated queue itself without using any other data structures.

Input Format:
The first list of input contains an integer 't' denoting the number of test cases/queries to be run.
Then the test cases follow.
The first line input for each test case/query contains an integer N, denoting the total number of elements in the queue.
The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space, representing the order in which the elements are enqueued into the queue.

Output Format:
For each test case/query, the only line of output prints the order in which the queue elements are dequeued, all of them separated by a single space.
Output for every test case/query will be printed on a new line.

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^4
-2^31 <= data <= 2^31 - 1

Time Limit: 1sec
